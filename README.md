# devtools
**Devtools (`dtools`)** is a comprehensive CLI utility that consolidates reusable development scripts, tools, and 
references into a single, easy-to-use interface. Built with the [Bashly](https://github.com/DannyBen/bashly) framework, it serves multiple purposes:

- **Script Repository**: A centralized collection of battle-tested bash scripts for common development tasks
- **Functional Documentation**: Reference implementations showing how to interact with various tools and services
- **Quick Reference**: Documentation commands (like `tui` and `pentest` subcommands) that list useful tools and commands 
  you might not use daily

Whether you need to spin up a local database, manage AWS resources, analyze code, or just remember that one command you 
always forget, `dtools` has you covered.

## Nomenclature
The Devtools script is abbreviated as `dtools` in the command line. This is purely done so that tab completions
work with fewer keystrokes for the CLI itself. Most commonly, `dto<TAB>` will autocomplete to `dtools`.

---
## Warnings
* **I've only tested these scripts against Debian-based systems (Ubuntu, Pop!_OS, etc.). Some scripts may not
  work on other systems.**
* **Some scripts assume that `bash` is your default shell, and thus assume that your shell configuration files are
  `.bashrc`. If you use another shell, you may need to modify some scripts to fit your environment.**

## Installation
To install the `dtools` script, run the following command:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:Dark-Alex-17/devtools.git ~/.local/share/devtools && pushd ~/.local/share/devtools && make install && popd
```

This will install the repo to `~/.local/share/devtools` and run the `make install` command to build and install the
script to your local bin directory (usually `~/.local/bin`).

Just run `dtools --help` to get started!

## Building
To build the `dtools` script after making some changes, run the `build` target in the [`Makefile`](./Makefile):

```shell
make build
```

## Running the CLI
Assuming you've already run `make install`, the script should now be available on your `PATH`, so running it is as simple as:
`dtools --help`
